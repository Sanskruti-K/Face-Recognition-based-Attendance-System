# Face-Recognition-based-Attendance-System

The facial recognition technology can be used in recording the attendance through a high-resolution digital camera that detects and recognizes the faces of the students. The system compares the recognized face with students face images stored in the database. Once the face of the student is matched with the stored image, then the attendance is marked in attendance database for further calculation. If the captured image doesn't match with the students face present in the database, then this image is stored as a new image onto the database.

Features: 
* The system stores the faces that are detected and automatically marks attendance. 
* Provide authorized access. 
* Multiple face detection.
* It uses Haar Cascade algorithm for face detection and for face recognition LBPH algorithm is used.

* Software Requirements: 
windows7 or higher, Net Beans IDE, MS Access DB, JDK1.8 or higher version

* Hardware Requirements: 
High resolution camera, Processor: I3 or I5 RAM: 4GB, Hard Disk: 80 GB or above 

* Technology: JAVA, OpenCV
